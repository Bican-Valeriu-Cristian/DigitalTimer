This circuit diagram represents a digital timer capable of counting seconds up to one minute. The circuit operates by generating a clock signal with a precise frequency of 1 Hz (once per second) using an oscillator based on the NE555 timer. This signal is connected to the count-up input of an integrated circuit counter. Since the counter dedicated to seconds has a 4-bit output, it can count up to 15. Therefore, it requires conditioning with logic circuits to prevent it from exceeding the value of 10. Each time this number is reached, a count-up signal is also sent to a second counter dedicated to tens of seconds. This counter also requires logic conditioning, but this time up to the value of 6.

The 4 bits produced by each counter are then fed into a binary-to-7-segment decoder, which finally allows the numbers to be displayed on 7-segment displays. Additionally, the circuit includes two switches, one for starting and stopping the timer and another for resetting the count.
